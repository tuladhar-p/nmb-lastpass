# nmb-lastpass

Chrome extension to integrate [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) with [NMB e-ebanking portal](https://www.nmbbank.net/).

#### What's the use of this extension?

NMB e-banking portal restricts auto-filling of username/password fields via password managers (i.e, LastPass). This chrome extension removes that restriction, thus allowing more secure way to input username/password directly from password managers (i.e, LastPass).
